/* 
In native MongoDB driver, the MongoDB connection is live within the scope of the MongoClient.connect() 
callback function, and you can use it to perform database operations until you explicitly close the 
connection using client.close().
But in mongoose, the popular MongoDB object modeling library for Node.js, the connection to the MongoDB server is 
established differently from the native MongoDB driver. Mongoose provides a more declarative and 
modular way to manage the database connection.
With Mongoose, the connection to MongoDB is established only once when you call
mongoose.connect(). Once connected, the connection remains active and is automatically
managed by Mongoose. You don't need to explicitly manage the connection as you do with
the native MongoDB driver.
The connection remains live throughout the lifetime of your application. Mongoose handles
reconnections and connection errors behind the scenes, ensuring that you can perform database
operations seamlessly without worrying about managing the connection manually.
